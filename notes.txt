Playwright is a ruby scripting framework.

Thoughts
======================================================
I should be able to write ruby code that will run as a regular bash command.
Each ruby script (called a play) will have a `run` class method that is called
  when the command is run in the terminal.
Playwright will have a generator that lets me run terminal commands to build
  templates for new plays.

The Generator
======================================================
All commands start with `playwright` except for the installer

1. `sh installer.sh path_to_bash_profile`
  - Installs playwright by:
    a. building empty file structure below.
    b. putting path_to_bash_profile in config.json
    c. copying itself into ~/playwright/.src

2. `playwright g play [play_name]`
  - Builds a new play template whose class name and bash command will both be 
    `play_name`. Class name will be adjusted to ruby conventions, but bash
    command will not change.

3. `playwright g module [module_name]`
  - Creates a very bland, empty module with the name given in the lib/modules directory.

4. `playwright g class [class_name]`
  - Creates a very bland, empty class with the name given in the lib/modules directory.
  
5. `playwright apply`
  - Builds a .generated_commands.sh file with all the plays in the plays folder.
  - Sources bash profile.
  
6. `playwright update`
  - downloads latest version from github and runs installer.sh
  
7. `playwright uninstall`
  - `rm -rf ~/playwright`
  
8. `playwright d play [play_name]`
  - deletes the play with that play_name
  
9. `playwright d module [module_name]`
  - deletes the module
  
10. `playwright d class [class_name]`
  - deletes the class
  
11. `playwright list`
  - lists all plays

Inside of plays/play_1/src is where you build your script.
Feel free to expand inside of that folder and use subclasses.
Use lib/ to put modules that you use across scripts.
